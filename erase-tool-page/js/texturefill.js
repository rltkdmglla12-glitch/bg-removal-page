/**
 * Exemplar fill — repair a hole by COPYING real texture from the same image,
 * instead of asking a network to imagine what belongs there.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * When a watermark is opaque, the pixels underneath are genuinely gone and
 * something has to invent them. MI-GAN does that, and on faces or foliage it is
 * the right tool. But on the backgrounds these badges actually sit on —
 * wood planks, brick, fabric, paper, a plain wall — it produces a flat smear
 * with visible edges, because a small generative model asked for a patch of
 * "wood" returns the average of all wood it ever saw rather than *this* wood.
 *
 * Repetitive texture does not need to be imagined. It is already in the picture,
 * a few centimetres away.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS
 * ------------
 * Find the single translation that best explains the neighbourhood of the hole,
 * then copy the hole's contents from there.
 *
 * Concretely: for every candidate offset, compare the KNOWN pixels immediately
 * around the hole against those same pixels shifted by that offset. The offset
 * that matches best is, by construction, one where the surrounding texture lines
 * up — so the pixels it points at are a plausible continuation of the structure
 * running through the hole. Wood grain stays a continuous line; plank seams stay
 * straight; the repair inherits real grain and real noise rather than a mean.
 *
 * This is the single-offset case of exemplar/patch-based inpainting. It is far
 * simpler than PatchMatch and, for the strongly repetitive backgrounds that
 * corner watermarks sit on, gets most of the benefit.
 *
 * WHERE IT IS THE WRONG TOOL
 * --------------------------
 * If nothing nearby resembles the hole's surroundings — a face, a caption, a
 * unique object — the best offset is still a poor one. So the match quality is
 * returned, and the caller falls back to the generative model when the texture
 * hypothesis is not supported. Copying the wrong region is worse than a smear.
