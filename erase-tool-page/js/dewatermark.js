/**
 * Watermark REMOVAL by un-blending, as opposed to inpainting.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Inpainting deletes the masked pixels and asks a generative model to invent
 * replacements. For an opaque badge that is the only option — the original
 * content really is gone. But most AI-generator watermarks are *semi-transparent*,
 * and that changes everything: the original content is still present in those
 * pixels, merely blended with the badge.
 *
 *     observed = alpha * watermark + (1 - alpha) * original
 *
 * Which rearranges to:
 *
 *     original = (observed - alpha * watermark) / (1 - alpha)
 *
 * So if we can estimate `alpha` (how opaque the badge is at each pixel) and
 * `watermark` (its colour, nearly always white), we can RECOVER the true pixels
 * instead of fabricating plausible ones. Wood grain, skin texture, brick, hair —
 * all of it survives, because it was never actually destroyed.
 *
 * This is the difference between "the watermark is gone and the texture
 * continues underneath it" and "there is a smudge of nearby colours where the
 * watermark used to be".
 *
 * ESTIMATING THE TWO UNKNOWNS
 * ---------------------------
 * `watermark` colour: these badges are drawn in white or near-white, so we
 * check whether the marked area is lighter or darker than its surroundings and
 * take white or black accordingly. Both are supported because some badges are
 * dark-on-light.
 *
 * `alpha`: we need the background that lies *under* the badge. We estimate only
 * its LOW-FREQUENCY component by diffusing surrounding colour inward (a discrete
 * Laplace solve). That sounds like the very "fill with nearby colours" this is
 * meant to avoid — the crucial difference is that we do not use that fill as the
 * output. We use it only as a baseline to solve for alpha, and then the actual
 * detail comes back out of the observed pixels. The interpolation supplies the
 * illumination level; the real data supplies the texture.
 *
 *     alpha = (observed - background) / (watermark - background)
 *
 * WHERE THIS HONESTLY CANNOT WIN
 * ------------------------------
 * As alpha approaches 1 the badge is opaque, the division explodes, and no
 * information about the original survives. Those pixels are reported back in
 * `residualMask` so the caller can hand just that core to the inpainter. A
 * typical badge then needs generative fill over a far smaller area than the
 * whole badge — often none at all.
